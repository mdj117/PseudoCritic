						</header>
						<p>As a story about the 9/11 attack, The Memory of Things is a wonderful read. The author, Gae Polisner uses her amazing character building skills to create a vivid story with a fascinating adventure. The plot is about Kyle, a boy, who finds an amnesiac on the bridge when he's trying to escape the collapsing Twin Towers. She's on the railing, ready to suicide, ash coating her body. Kyle stops her, takes her home and tries to fix her broken memory. Meanwhile, the reader has insight into the girl's perspective through poetry. This is awesome. The girl, (spoiler alert) who is a ballerina, talks in poetic language, practically in song. Poetry (like her amnesiac thoughts) is broken and doesn't make her thoughts weird and boring, rather, they seem mysterious and thought-provoking.  Since the girl doesn’t know her name (till like half the book) Polisner manages to keep the story moving along with descriptions like “Swimmer girl” instead, which is to say, pretty impressive.</p>

						</header>
						<p>Out of the pile of books I received as a gift, the Red Queen by Victoria Aveyard has been the best one till now. As a story that follows a similar plot to Veronica Roth’s Divergent, the Red Queen turns out to be another book that doesn’t fail to live up to the it’s reputation. The main character’s Mare, who isn’t the typical girly girl. She’s snarky, sassy and straight forward. In Mare’s world, the society is divided by blood: Red and Silver. The Reds are supposed to be the lower class while the supreme Silvers control her world. Born out of a Red family, Mare has been raised the harsh way, experiencing straight out violence and censorship: A life that no one wants to live. At the age of 17( Yes, 17!), the Reds are conscripted into the army, but (spoiler alert)when it’s Mare’s turn she attempts to escape. Thankfully, she isn’t caught, but before she escapes, she manages to get a job at the Silver’s Palace. This is a big deal especially for a Red like Mare. But her job at the Palace, isn’t what she expected. In fact, she discovers something about herself that she never knew. Now, it’s up to Mare to figure out whether she must fix herself and if there are others like her. The plot’s to long and complex to share and plus, it’s worth reading! Anyway, the plot falls into battles and action and stuff and though it’s complex, it’s not something you need to think about or really decode. It’s pretty interesting and soon you’ll be trapped Mare’s thrilling world.</p>

							<!--Add the team member page to the href tag-->
							<p class="info">"A romantic twist with a twinge of supernatural" - <a href="#">Tanushka</p>
						</header>
						<p>As a tale propelled with prophecies, mysterious characters and multiple POVs, Maggie Stiefvater’s Raven Boys was certainly an unexpected page-turner. The story trails a young girl (I didn’t expect it either) named Blue Sargent (yes, it’s sort of unusual), who’s been told her whole life one thing: “If Blue was to kiss her true love, he would die.” (sorry romantics) Maybe this wouldn’t be something a normal girl would believe, but after being reminded by her whole family (who’s a bunch of psychics) repeatedly, Blue has no option but to believe them. So on St. Mark’s Eve (when Blue’s aunt sees the spirits of the those who will die in 12 months), Blue sees a spirit (for the first time in her life). It’s a boy, who, she’s either destined to fall in love with or murder. And his name’s Gansey. As a result, Blue ends up falling into a rabbit hole where not only does she meet Gansey, but tries her best to stop him from dying and letting her prophecy come true.</p>
