As a tale propelled with prophecies, mysterious characters and multiple POVs, Maggie Stiefvater’s Raven Boys was certainly an unexpected page-turner. The story trails a young girl (I didn’t expect it either) named Blue Sargent (yes, it’s sort of unusual), who’s been told her whole life one thing: “If Blue was to kiss her true love, he would die.” (sorry romantics) Maybe this wouldn’t be something a normal girl would believe, but after being reminded by her whole family (who’s a bunch of psychics) repeatedly, Blue has no option but to believe them. So on St. Mark’s Eve (when Blue’s aunt sees the spirits of the those who will die in 12 months), Blue sees a spirit (for the first time in her life). It’s a boy, who, she’s either destined to fall in love with or murder. And his name’s Gansey. As a result, Blue ends up falling into a rabbit hole where not only does she meet Gansey, but tries her best to stop him from dying and letting her prophecy come true. I’m not going to tell you the whole story again, but just this: (spoiler alert)<span class="spoiler">Blue never really falls for Gansey in the whole book.</span> <br><br>

Does Gansey know as much as Blue does? Nope.Turns out, Gansey has his own thing going for him. Unlike Blue, who’s poor and surrounded by her fortune-telling aunts and mother, Gansey is dead rich and lives with his friends, away from his family. For me, Gansey is the true picture of arrogance and within the story, has a very interesting backstory. When Blue sees Gansey’s spirit (this may sound confusing) Gansey is there too. He hears her voice ask his name and his own voice reply, but nothing else. He doesn’t know about the prophecy. But that’s not the reason Gansey was there in the first place. In fact, Gansey was there for a very different reason. As a person who had contact with spirits and has almost died, Gansey has been on the search for (spoiler alert) <span class="spoiler"> ley-line: the network of energy for psychics and corpses, in other words, the dead. Gansey, who’s been burdened by his own father's image, has been determined to find a lost king (which revolves around another prophecy) and basically, the king’s supposed to grant him whatever he wants if Gansey wakes him up.</span>  Unfortunately, The story’s too complex to discuss in this review, so I just recommend you read the book instead. (Otherwise, I’ll just be confusing you if I tell you more.) <br><br>
 
Anyway, what really interested me here was, Stiefvater’s usage of a prophecy based plot. This kind of plot is very common and (as all the Hogwarts fans know) one the JK Rowling used in Harry Potter. But what really interested me was, why include a psychic family? Personally, it actually makes a lot of sense. With a psychic family, Stiefvater could not only make the prophecy seem real and possible but also create a flawed character. Blue, unlike the rest of the family, doesn’t have psychic abilities. Instead, she has the ability to make their readings stronger and harness the energy. This energy (or rather, power) is what makes Blue so different. She’s not like normal human beings nor is she a psychic and like her Aunt Neeve says, puts her in an “identity crisis.” Like any great character, Blue is stuck struggling with not one problem but multiple ones. As a result, her sensibility (as everyone puts it) clashes with her thoughts and situations, making the reader wonder what she’s going to do next. By giving her a queer name, an irresistible personality and a mysterious family, Stiefvater creates a truly unique figure, one that will be remembered by every reader. <br><br>

But what about Gansey? Is he just as interesting? As it turns out, he is (but in a very different way). As I mentioned before Gansey is a very pretentious spoiled man and as he develops we see another side of him. This is what I really love about Stiefvater’s characters. By giving us a hard and very formal Gansey but then revealing him as a character who just wants to protect everyone, we see a trait normal in almost everyone around us, that is, the theory of appearances. With this change in masks, Stiefvater creates a character who’s not just fake but real too. But Gansey isn’t my favourite character. Another person I really loved was Adam, (spoiler alert) <span class="spoiler">Blue’s true love interest. </span> I know you may be shocked (so was I), but it’s true, (spoiler alert) <span class="spoiler"> Blue and Adam really are a thing. </span> Anyway, Adam is the typical sweet kid, the one who’ll give you his sandwich if you’re starving or just sacrifice his raincoat even if he needs to walk home in the rain. No matter what, he’s always by your side and according to me, he’s the weakling of the pack. He’s timid and shy and definitely poor. Unlike Gansey, Adam’s in his school with a scholarship because he’s smart. He’s the kid who does his homework on time, tops the class and barely curses or fights. That’s why he’s so perfect for Blue.  She’s smart and sensible and sensitive too. So it turns out, they’re a perfect match. As we move on though, we see a change in Adam’s character. He becomes stronger (as if some of Blue’s energy has transferred to him) and at the end, (spoiler alert) <span class="spoiler"> not only leaves his abusive father but actually is the most courageous out of the four.</span><br><br>

Honestly, I just loved this book! I can’t get the character’s out of my head and now, I’m craving to read the second one. So what are you waiting for? Check out this book at your local bookstore now and I assure you, you won’t be able to put it down until the end.
<br>Until next time!
