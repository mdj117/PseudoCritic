As a story about the 9/11 attack, The Memory of Things is a wonderful read. The author, Gae Polisner uses her amazing character building skills to create a vivid story with a fascinating adventure. The plot is about Kyle, a boy, who finds an amnesiac on the bridge when he's trying to escape the collapsing Twin Towers. She's on the railing, ready to suicide, ash coating her body. Kyle stops her, takes her home and tries to fix her broken memory. Meanwhile, the reader has insight into the girl's perspective through poetry. This is awesome. The girl (spoiler alert),<span class="spoiler"> who is a ballerina, talks in poetic language, practically in song.</span> Poetry (like her amnesiac thoughts) is broken and doesn't make her thoughts weird and boring, rather, they seem mysterious and thought-provoking.  Since the girl doesn’t know her name (till like half the book) Polisner manages to keep the story moving along with descriptions like “Swimmer girl” instead, which is to say, pretty impressive.<br><br>

The girl also has a very interesting character. By giving her costume wings, a malfunctioning brain and no clear thought process, Polisner creates a character who’s confused about her identity. I think the fact that she doesn’t know who she is (literally), makes it more intriguing yet, it gives Kyle a mystery to solve. With tiny snippets of her memory and clues like her (spoiler alert)<span class="spoiler"> school ID,  Polisner drags the reader into a true identity crisis. </span> <br><br>
 
What about Kyle? Is he as broken as she is? Yes!  His parents, his dad actually is helping in rescuing the survivors. Simultaneously, his mom, who’s taken his sister to LA for an audition, is still stuck at the airport, creating a sort of orphan-like atmosphere for Kyle. Since his parents aren’t with him, not only does Kyle have to take care of the girl but his Uncle Matt too. (Spoiler alert) <span class="spoiler">Uncle Matt’s paralysis, really affected Kyle and Kyle’s pretty desperate to get him fixed. So, while the girl has her own problems Kyle has his. He needs to keep contacting his parents, take care of his uncle, the girl and himself and figure out who she really is. That’s a lot. Even if you’re 16. Trust me, I know. But that’s not it.</span> <br><br>

Polisner (like an amazing author) manages to drizzle in some love too. Since a pretty girl’s living with him, Kyle falls for her and they actually get to together. I know love and stuff but here’s what makes it interesting: Kyle feels guilty because there’s like an ‘apocalypse’ outside and here he is, inside, falling in love.  His doubts about love create an inner conflict. One that wants the girl to be with him forever and another, that wants to figure out who she truly is and get her home. By creating such a strong plot weaved in with equally strong emotions, Polisner not only creates a memorable story but memorable characters too. 


But is it really worth reading till the end? Yes. It truly is. Not only do we get to know who the girl is but we get a full paragraph instead of poetry from her! It’s pretty amazing because her paragraph’s the only poetic paragraph in the book! Anyway, the author also links her father to Kyle’s Dad and in the end, we get to know, whether Kyle really lets her go. 
Honestly, I think this book is perfect for any who loves a good adventure with a hint of love. I guess my favourite characters would be Kyle and the girl. I just can’t decide! Both of them are pretty awesome people and I love them both!
