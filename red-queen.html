Out of the pile of books I received as a gift, the Red Queen by Victoria Aveyard has been the best one till now. As a story that follows a similar plot to Veronica Roth’s Divergent, the Red Queen turns out to be another book that doesn’t fail to live up to the it’s reputation. The main character’s Mare, who isn’t the typical girly girl. She’s snarky, sassy and straight forward. In Mare’s world, the society is divided by blood: Red and Silver. The Reds are supposed to be the lower class while the supreme Silvers control her world. Born out of a Red family, Mare has been raised the harsh way, experiencing straight out violence and censorship: A life that no one wants to live. At the age of 17( Yes, 17!), the Reds are conscripted into the army, but (spoiler alert)<span class="spoiler">when it’s Mare’s turn she attempts to escape. Thankfully, she isn’t caught, but before she escapes, she manages to get a job at the Silver’s Palace. This is a big deal especially for a Red like Mare. But her job at the Palace, isn’t what she expected. In fact, she discovers something about herself that she never knew. </span> Now, it’s up to Mare to figure out whether she must fix herself and if there are others like her. The plot’s to long and complex to share and plus, it’s worth reading! Anyway, the plot falls into battles and action and stuff and though it’s complex, it’s not something you need to think about or really decode. It’s pretty interesting and soon you’ll be trapped Mare’s thrilling world.<br><br>

The book’s a combination of love and dystopian fantasy along with adventure. Victoria Aveyard weaves Mare’s character in expertly and shapes a character who doesn’t prioritize herself but her people. Mare’s strong and very determined, one who feels pretty guilt about almost everything. But Aveyard does this to create a strong connection between her character and the plot. The feeling of guilt, isn’t liked by anyone and as a reader, we understand how Mare feels and can totally relate to her. Mare also has very intense backstory. With her brothers gone to war, Mare is the oldest sibling in her home and feels that she must take of her family. Moreover, Mare’s dad went to war too and now, is stuck with a machine in his heart, giving Mare the incentive to protect herself from conscription and attempt to escape. The fact that Mare also has such a broken family who are Reds, helps us empathize with her and understand her emotions really well, especially the bond she shares with her sister. But Mare isn’t just close to her family. Her friend (and sort of son), Kilorn is an orphan who Mare has practically raised her whole life and now, she feels destined to save him. With these burdens and Mare’s strong-minded character, Aveyard creates a memorable character who a reader cannot help but fall in love with.<br><br>

What about the other characters? Since I’m not revealing the whole plot, I’ll just tell you about my favourite Silver (spoiler alert): <span class="spoiler">Cal. Cal is a wonderful boy who never fails to keep his word. He’s the one who saves Mare and throughout the book, he proves that he’d do anything for her. (well almost everything…) Mare, she becomes his good friend, can’t help but start falling for him. Yes romantics! </span> Using these two characters, Aveyard squeezes in them into a complex romantic subplot: One that keeps Mare torn between her emotions and her desperation to help her people. As a result, Cal represents the good in Mare’s life and though we readers like him,( spoiler alert) <span class="spoiler">Mare can’t help but question his true character and whether she can truly trust him. Mainly because he’s a Silver. </span> Yet, Aveyard does portray Cal as loveable and caring and the reader is forced to wonder why she actually doubting him, creating a broken but beautiful character who the reader must think about. <br><br>

Does the book have anything different? Yes! Something that really fascinated me was the powers and magic involved. Each silver has different kinds of powers and depending on the strength of the power, they were placed in the class hierarchy. But the powers were extremely cool. Some involved telepathy and mind reading, harassing water and (spoiler alert) <span class="spoiler"> Cal’s: controlling fire. </span> But don’t worry tech and action freaks! There are guns and machines involved too! Like any good author, Aveyard manages to keep the modern perspective in mind and doesn’t completely immerse the story in a completely new world. Instead, she manages to introduce magic to a world thats already familiar to us.<br><br>

Overall, I think Aveyard did a wonderful job and really wrote an lovely book. She proves that a simple plot can be twisted into a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Personally, I’d recommend the Red Queen to everyone and anyone who loves the Hunger Games, Divergent or actually, books for that matter! It’s sure to keep you reading till the end.
