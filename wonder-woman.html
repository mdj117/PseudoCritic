						<h1>"A Movie of Contrasts."</h1>

<p>Not gonna lie, I was a little apprehensive about watching this movie. I was expecting the whole, ‘Oh my! This is a movie about a female superhero, let’s put make sure that’s the message in every scene. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The best part about it was that it was just another superhero movie, and not an excuse to put forth a social agenda. Wonder Woman, was just one of the guys.</p>

<p>Of course Princess Diana and Steve Trevor were the main focus of the movie, and there truly was admirable chemistry between them. Were there a few classic movie tropes like the guy and the girl in a slow dance, or the kissing after a tumultuous battle? Yes. However, the movie never tried to sell their relationship (even if everyone knew it was coming). Dianna and Steve start out as two people who happen to come across each other, to being friends, and then to the romance. The relationship develops.</p>

<p>I wish I could say the same about the protagonist, but like most movies, Wonder Woman, I believe makes the same mistake as other movies: the protagonist is composed of mostly the same traits and qualities, until the very end, where a sudden (emphasis on that word) maturation takes place. This is witnessed when Dianna is battling Ares. Interestingly enough, it is Trevor, who develops as a character throughout the film. Perhaps it is because of situation he’s put in, in having to be with Dianna, and having so much change take place around him. We see him become a smarter, a more passionate man towards the end, when he doesn’t just care about winning the fight against evil, but also about the people who’ve lost lives, and sees the repercussions of war.</p>

<p>In terms of the action sequences, I found myself appreciating the hand-to-hand combat that took place earlier in the film. It was well-choreographed, and there was intensity in the fighting that took place. Unlike other training montages, that claimed to be ferocious, this one with its characters’ brilliant acting, (Gal Gadot, and Robin Wright as Antiope) alongside the editing work, made it stand out. Alas, in the middle and the end, the movie resorted to the basic action sequences commonly found, as well explosions that never truly impacted me as a viewer. I wish that the fighting between Ares and Wonder Woman could’ve been more intimate, and personal. The entire conversation both characters claimed to be fighting for different ideals, that each believed was true, however there was no reflection in the combat. Like most movies Wonder Woman was losing the battle, until some event occurred, and changed the scales.</p>

<p>The plot itself, wasn’t too strong, and though an end goal was established, and met, the story was a shifting constantly between the fighting, and Dianna and Steve ‘s relationship. While I understand the need for the latter, I still would’ve appreciated more time being spent on the former. Also the idea of psyching the audience by making Patrick the ‘true villain’ really puts into question the idea of having the Germans, and their general, be villains anyway. In no way do we them related, for a twist to make sense other than that Patrick used them as pawns. (And even that just seems like a convenient plot point). What I did like however, was the idea of killing off Trevor. To me, that was a bold step to remove the second-most prominent character in the film, and in doing so, the time we saw him, becomes special, and the moments he shares with Dianna do so too.</p>  

<p>Now, to make a superhero movie truly spectacular, I have a litmus test: How good was the villain? Others may not have this but for me it’s super important, so let’s take the two: Ares, and General Erich Ludendorff. Neither villain appears to be intimidating, or have a real reason to fight. At least in the case of the latter, he is an army general, who wants to win World War 1, at any cost, however, the audience just gets a sense that he’s cruel, but don’t show him enough screen time. With Ares, I felt that his screen-time was being compensated for towards the end. It was as if suddenly the movie became an ideological battle. And as much I love the idea of it, there was not enough development of the plot, to suggest that. Ares’ intentions and motives were stuffed to the audience at the end.</p>

<p>Final verdict: A movie of contrasts.<br>7.9/10</p>
