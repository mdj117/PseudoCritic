<p>I have to admit, I had no idea what a blade runner was a few months ago, then on a hot day in August a friend showed me the trailer, in a crowded bus, in India. It’s an understatement to say that it wasn’t the best viewing experience to get me excited. Yet, after seeing even TechCrunch post about how “amazing" blade runner was going to be, I had to give it another chance.</p>

<p>Going into my first viewing of Blade Runner 2049, I was armed with the knowledge of the “final cut” of the original Blade runner, which I highly recommend, even thought this story is rather self contained and my friends who accompanied me into the second viewing without any knowledge of the Blade Runner universe generally enjoyed it as well. However, if you do watch any of the cuts of the original blade runner, you would certainly elevate your experience, in addition to getting a chance to show off your “knowledge” and how you get the references, before realising no one cares.</p>

<p>The thing that hit me the most prominently about Blade Runner 2049 was its sound design. While I didn’t get a chance to see the original theatrical release in the theatre, due me not even existing at that point of time; Nerdwriter’s video on its score did catch my eye. The sound design perfectly adds to the stunning visuals of the movie, and in most cases bring out a slow rising anxiety in a rather dull scenes, not to say that there are many dull scenes in this movie, honestly any 3 hour movie would have the same problem. Its not to say that Blade Runner 2049’s soundtrack is blasting for its 3 hour duration, in fact a minority of powerful scenes in the movie had no sound at all. This balance of quality sounds with dead silence made for a really griping experience to say the least.</p>

<p>Blade Runner 2049 may have been the first 3 hour movie to hold me at the edge of my seat for its entire duration. While some may complain that the pacing is sluggish to a certain extent, I believe the gaps between dialogue or action sequences exemplify the impact of those said sequences by giving the viewer some time to contemplate what just happened, and questioning is really important to enjoying this thriller. These gaps, usually in the form of “flying car travel sequences” remind me of the gap sequences in Half Life 2, they seem like a films “loading” sequence, not braking the flow, but allowing the viewers to return to the base-line before throwing another twist or fist fight right into their faces. This makes the ride, similar to a roller coaster, more enjoyable as it’s not ALWAYS IN YOUR FACE! AND HYPED UP!</p>

<p>I would say the purpose of Blade Runner 2049 is quite different from the Status quo, its not to push out another lazy money grabbing instalment, its rather to entice some well needed questions in the viewers minds, and to make another instant classic. “How do I know this is an instant classic ?” cause I watched it twice, for a combined viewing time of 5 hours and 26 minutes, and I never, not even once, checked my phone. The visuals were so astonishing and attention grabbing that it held my short span attention for all that time. Oh look a bunny!</p>

<p>The visuals were amazing, that’s quite obvious from any big budget production by Ridley Scott. The soundtrack accompanying those visuals were no surprise to be even better after all you have Hans Zimmer directing the score. The screenplay was faithful to the original, and expanding on the universe to even greater depth. Ryan Gosling certainly takes the cake in terms of acting, after all he is the main character, while Sylvia Hoeks, playing Wallace’s chief replicant Luv was a pleasant surprise. Wallace himself, played by Jared Leto, suffered the same fate as the Joker in Suicide squad and was seen in less than a tenth of the movie. The whole cast overall was phenomenal, while the much loved Detective Deckard returns again played by the ever smooth Harrison Ford, even thought he mostly returns for the third Act of the movie, Deckard is the driving force of this movie, and allows for a great ending.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t want to spoil Blade Runner 2049 for you. It’s great. Go watch it.<br>9/10</p>
